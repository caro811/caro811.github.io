excerpt: 'A contact \\(B_0\\)–VPG graph is a graph for which there exists a collection of nontrivial pairwise interiorly disjoint horizontal and vertical segments in one-to-one correspondence with its vertex set such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding segments share a grid-point that is an endpoint of at least one of the two segments. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, for a constant \\(c \in \mathbb{N}\\), determines if a \\(\\{C_{i \geq c}\\}\\)–free graph with bounded number of holes (cycles of length at least four) is contact \\(B_0\\)–VPG.'
